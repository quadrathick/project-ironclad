## System Features

* Real-Time Room Boarding: High-concurrency venue reservation utilizing Redis-backed distributed locks and WebSockets to eliminate race conditions and double-booking.
* Digital Campaign Generator: Browser-based HTML5 Canvas client-side engine enabling students to generate campaign overlays directly.
* MIS Administrative Dashboard: Live, event-driven monitoring for room occupancy state and asset metrics.
* Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): Strict security boundaries separating MIS Administrators, Class Presidents, and Students.
* Automated Event Pipeline: Asynchronous webhooks triggering campaign template generation upon venue approval.

## Team & Domain Responsibilities

* **Database Lead**: PostgreSQL schema design, migration management, and database seeding via `/packages/database`
* **Frontend Developer**: Client UI, Tailwind Styling, and HTML5 Canvas Engine Implementation via `/apps/web`
* **Backend Developer**: REST APIs, WebSocket event handlers, Redis locking logic via `/apps/server`
* **Fullstack Developer**: Feature Integration across server/client layers, state management and webhooks.
* **Quality Assurance**: Inspect the initial website, analyze possible bugs, loopholes, security measures.

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/quadrathick/project-ironclad
```

2. Install all dependencies across workspaces:
```
npm install
```

3. Run the frontend development server:
```
npm run dev --workspaces=apps/web
```

## Development Workflow

1. Always pull the latest changes from `main` before creating a new branch:
```
git checkout main
git pull origin main
```

2. Create a feature branch following the naming standard (`feat/feature-name` e.g `db/integration-schema`):
```
git checkout -b feat/your-feature
```

3. Open a PR (Pull Request) on GitHub **against** `main` upon completion for code review. Direct pushes to `main` are **restricted**.
